# SupplyGuard-The-One-Sentence-Summary
# SupplyGuard Open

SupplyGuard is the first Microsoft 365 security layer designed to protect organisations
against a rapidly-emerging blind spot: **external Microsoft 365 tenants** used during
supplier collaboration.

While enterprises invest heavily in MFA, Conditional Access, DLP and Zero Trust inside
their own tenant, those controls disappear the moment a user opens a Teams meeting,
SharePoint folder or shared chat that belongs to a supplier’s tenant.

SupplyGuard changes that — by giving security and procurement teams:

- **One-click supplier onboarding**  
- **Automated permissions & governance**  
- **External tenant risk scoring (0–100)**  
- **Alerts when supplier posture becomes dangerous**
- **Auto-expiry and revocation controls**

This repository contains the open-source components, community documentation, example automation scripts, and integration foundations for the SupplyGuard product line.
